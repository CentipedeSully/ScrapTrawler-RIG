# ScrapTrawler-RIG
Project where you play as a ship scrapping ships!

Core Concept:
"Top Down Spaceship Resource Management Game"

Gaemplay Loop:
"Scrap Wreckages to earn valuable resources! Either manually cut ships to pieces, or have crewmembers loot em from the inside, or just take the whole thing altogether!"

Feature Ideas:
> Manage Crew by docking wreckages and letting them work. Pick them up once they secure the goods
> Tugging entire wreckages to a station where that ship can be either parted out or restored for use
> Buying and upgrading tools to scrap ships
> Rescuing stranded individuals!
> Customizing the RIG!
> Jumping to mission Systems
> Missions?

Just scrap the ships ^_^
